\entry{Comprehensive examination}{Second-year students can opt to complete the independent study portion of their comprehensive examination in this course.  (This option is not available in continuing education courses.)  The project will count for 10\% of the student's final grade, while the usual course mark will count for 90\%.  The following exceptions should be noted:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the case where the student's course mark is less than 60\%, the independent project will not count towards the final course grade;
	\item In the case where the student's course mark is greater than 60\%, the independent project will not lower the course grade below 60\%;
	\item Irrespective of the course grade, a project that successfully meets the independent project criteria will result in a passing grade for this component of the comprehensive examination.
\end{enumerate}
