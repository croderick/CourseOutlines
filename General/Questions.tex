\entry{Questions outside class}{
\begin{itemize}
	\item All regular day program teachers will be available in their respective offices to their students during posted office hours.  In the first week, your teacher will inform you of their schedule and will post it outside their office.
	\item Room 7A.1 is the physics study room. At scheduled times, a teacher or peer tutor will be on duty there to answer your questions. The schedule of teachers and peer tutors will be posted outside of 7A.1 in the 2nd or 3rd week of term.
	\item Many teachers in the Physics Department will communicate with their students using FirstClass. This software allows teachers and students to share information, use email and much more. You can access FirstClass via the MyDawson portal or using the following link:
