{This course will cover some of the basic concepts of biomechanics. Students will learn the laws governing motion, forces and their interactions, work, energy and rotation. These notions will be applied to problems involving equilibrium, movement, and the limits of the human body. Fundamental concepts of waves and electricity will also be covered as an introduction to therapeutic electrotherapy techniques.}
