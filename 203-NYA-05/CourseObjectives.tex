\entry{Course \mbox{objectives}}
{The role of this course in the program is two-fold. First, it presents the basic principles of mechanics -- kinematics, dynamics, and the three conservation laws (energy, momentum and angular momentum) -- which are essential to the study of all the natural sciences. Second, it provides an opportunity for students to develop problem solving skills.
\smallskip

The laws and concepts introduced in this course are the foundation of our scientific view of the world. Ideas about force, motion, energy and momentum arise again and again in all the sciences and in daily life. Understanding them is essential to the education of a scientist or an engineer. In every physics, chemistry, geology and even biology course at college and university, concepts such as energy and momentum, first learned in mechanics, will be generalized, broadened, deepened and applied.
